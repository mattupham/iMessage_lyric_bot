Trey, I was like yo Trey?
Do you think you can buy me a bottle of Rose?
Okay let's get it now
I'm wit' a bad bitch, he's wit' his friends
I don't say I hi, I say keys to the Benz
Keys to the Benz, keys to the Benz
Mu'fuckin' rite yea V to the 10
If a bitch try to get cute I'm a stomp her
Throw alotta money at her then yell fuck her
Fuck her, fuck her, then yell fuck her
Then I'm go and get my Louisville slugger
Excuse me I'm sorry, I'm really such a lady
I rep Young Money
You know Slim, Baby
And we be doin' donuts while we wave in the 3-80
We give a lot of money to the babies out in Haiti
Yellin' all around the world
Do you hear me? Do you like my body Anna Nicki?
Rest in peace to Ana Nicole Smith

Say hi to Mary, Mary and Joseph

Bottoms up, bottoms up (up)

Bottoms up, bottoms up (up)

Bottoms up (up)
Bottoms up (up)
